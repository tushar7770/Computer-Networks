## Labs overview :<br>
<p>LAB-1 : <br>
1. Perform CRC on the given data and key. Check the message correctness on the Receiver side.</p>
<p>LAB-2 : <br>
1. Perform Vertical Redundancy Check on given data.<br>
2. Perform Longitudinal Redundancy Check<br>
3. Perform Checksum</p>
<p>LAB-3 :<br>
 1. Write a code that accepts a message, and is given with a Parity bit type (Even/Odd). Compute Hamming code and Identify the error bit position.</p>
 <p>LAB-4 :<br>
1. Write an application for establishing simple Socket programming.<br>
2. Write a code that creates the following<br>
          a. Bit Stuffing<br>
          b. Character Count<br>
          c. Byte Stuffing<br>
3. Write a simple application that works on the "Simple Stop and Wait" Policy (Simulate the application in your preferred language).</p>
<p>LAB-5 :<br>
1. Implement go back n<br>
2. Implement Selective repeat</p>
<p>LAB-6 :<br>
1. Write a program to identify the class of a given IP address. Prompt the user to enter an IP address, validate the IP address and identify its class. Convert the given IP address to binary; based on the IP address identify the class and display the output.<br>
2. Write a simple program to demonstrate the UDP protocol. </p>
<p>LAB-7 :<br>
1. Consider a big single network of any class. Create and calculate the following:<br>a.) Divide the network into subnets.<br>b.) Total number of IP addresses<br>c.) Total number of hosts.<br>d.) Range of IP Address.<br>e.) Direct and Limited broadcast
address.<br>f.) Routing Table (Subnet ID, SubnetMask, and Interface)</p>
<p>LAB-8 :<br>
1. Given the Routing Table  with "n" nodes, Work on "Distance Vector Routing Algorithm", where<br>
Inputs: No of nodes, edges, and weights (distance)<br>
Output: the calculated value of distance (minimum).</p>
<p>LAB-9 :<br>
1. Given the Routing Table  with "n" nodes,Work on "Link State Routing Algorithm", where<br>
Inputs: No of nodes, edges, and weights (distance)<br>
Output: the calculated value of distance (minimum).</p>
